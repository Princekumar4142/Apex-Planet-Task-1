Internship Task 1: Building a Foundation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Thrilled to share the codebase for Task 1 of my internship at ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd.! This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into the fundamentals of web development and apply my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Project Overview:**
This repository holds a small-scale web project that demonstrates my proficiency in building a clean, responsive, and interactive user interface. It’s a representation of the skills I’ve been honing throughout my first task.

**What you'll find here:**
- **HTML:** The semantic structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling and responsive design to ensure a great user experience across different devices.
- **JavaScript:** Client-side scripting for added interactivity and dynamic content.

This task has been an incredible journey of learning by doing, and I’m excited to continue building on this foundation.
